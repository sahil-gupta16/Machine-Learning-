Objective : To predict the price of the house based on the set of predictors in King County, Washington, US.

In this project, given a dataset that records the house prices of 9,761 houses in King County, Washington, US. The house prices are recorded along with some other attributes like - area of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of floors etc.
